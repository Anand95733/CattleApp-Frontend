# ✅ SC Visits Integration - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 All Issues Resolved Successfully!

### ✅ **Issue 1: Camera/Gallery Functionality - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Camera showed placeholder message
- **Solution**: Installed `react-native-image-crop-picker` and implemented real functionality
- **Result**: Camera, Gallery, and Enter URL options all work perfectly

### ✅ **Issue 2: Failed to Load Cattle Information - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Error when clicking "Add First Visit"
- **Solution**: Added robust API endpoint fallback logic
- **Result**: Form loads successfully even if some endpoints fail

### ✅ **Issue 3: Visits Not Showing After Creation - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Visit created successfully but not visible in list
- **Solution**: Backend created new API endpoint `/api/sc-visits/by-animal/{animal_id}/`
- **Result**: All visits now display properly after creation
