## Specific Fix for Animal `db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1`

The app now provides specific diagnostics and suggestions for this animal:

### Automatic Detection
- The app automatically detects when this specific animal has image issues
- Provides targeted suggestions in development console
- Generates Django commands to fix the issue

### Manual Diagnostics
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
node debug-image-404.js
```

### Django Server Fixes
1. **Check if the image file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la media/animal_photos/db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1/
   ```

2. **If folder is missing, create it:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p media/animal_photos/db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1
   chmod 755 media/animal_photos/db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1
   ```

3. **Check database record:**
   ```python
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from your_app.models import Animal
   >>> animal = Animal.objects.get(animal_id='db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1')
   >>> print(f'Front photo: {animal.front_photo_url}')
   ```

4. **If image path is wrong, update it:**
   ```python
   >>> animal.front_photo_url = 'animal_photos/db2c211e-f6bd-43cf-8c19-10f26add9cc1/front.jpg'
   >>> animal.save()
   ```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Blank/broken images in cattle lists
- ❌ App crashes when tapping cattle items with missing images
- ❌ No indication of what went wrong
- ❌ Poor error handling

### After Fix
- ✅ Graceful fallback to alternative images when primary image is missing
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for missing images
- ✅ Robust navigation error handling
- ✅ Detailed diagnostics in development mode
- ✅ Automatic recovery attempts
- ✅ Better user feedback

## Technical Improvements

### Image Loading Strategy
1. **Primary Image**: Try the main image URL first
2. **Fallback Images**: If primary fails, try alternative images (left, right, muzzle1, etc.)
3. **Alternative Paths**: Generate common alternative file paths
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Show informative placeholder if all images fail

### Error Handling
- Specific handling for 404 (file not found) errors
- Specific handling for 403 (permission denied) errors
- Network timeout handling
- Invalid URL detection

### Development Tools
- Comprehensive logging and diagnostics
- Automatic issue detection
- Specific fix suggestions
- Django command generation

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Run the diagnostic script: `node debug-image-404.js`
2. Check development console for automatic diagnostics
3. Test navigation to cattle details from beneficiary profile
4. Verify fallback images work when primary images are missing

### Automated Testing
- Image URL validation
- Fallback URL generation
- Error handling scenarios
- Navigation error recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Run Diagnostics**: Use the provided tools to identify all animals with missing images
2. **Fix Server Issues**: Follow the Django fix suggestions for missing files
3. **Monitor**: Check development console for ongoing image issues
4. **Update Database**: Ensure all image paths in database are correct
5. **Re-upload**: Re-upload missing images through the app interface
